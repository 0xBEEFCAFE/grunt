Welcome to **Grunt API** - the unofficial way to use official Halo Infinite APIs. Here be **a lot of dragons** and this is not yet ready to be a standalone package, since the changes will be frequent and large. That said, you can use it as a test pad for your own explorations.

>**Current stable package ETA:** February 2022

## Endpoints

Complete list of endpoints can be obtained by querying the official Halo Infinite API:

```bash
https://settings.svc.halowaypoint.com/settings/hipc/e2a0a7c6-6efe-42af-9283-c2ab73250c48
```

The endpoint above does not require authentication and can be queried in the open.
