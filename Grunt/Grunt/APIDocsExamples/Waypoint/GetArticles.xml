He’d spent enough time with this group to know that Spartan Nina Kovan &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;had “eyes on.” Kovan was a no-nonsense, walking death sentence with an aim as true as her word. And as Fireteam Shadow’s designated marksman, she did indeed have eyes on everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Affirmative. Is Stone in range of the summit site?” Kovan adjusted the advanced optics suite integrated into her GUNGNIR-class Mjolnir armor to key in on the nearby Covenant firebase that had been established just two days earlier. “Looks like they haven’t gotten their ball to roll just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s ‘got the ball rolling,’ Nina.” Spartan Bonita Stone couldn’t help but crack a smile at Kovan’s butchering of yet another antiquated colloquialism. “But that’s good news regardless. Might just be able stop their little airshow before it even starts.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Covenant summit site was designed specifically to mass produce fighter craft at a rapid pace—shutting that process down would deal a significant blow to the alien alliance’s ability to gain air superiority in the local sector. For the better part of the week, Fireteam Shadow had been just one of several Spartan fireteams deployed from the UNSC flagship &lt;em&gt;Infinity &lt;/em&gt;to battle a zealous Covenant remnant faction for control of an artificial world called Requiem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Agreed.” Fry interjected. “Shadow Four, how’re your baby birds looking?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Props are hot and charges primed. Just waiting on your signal.” Shadow Four was Spartan Jason Kidman, whose voice would have sounded raspy even without being fed through the comms mic of his OPERATOR helmet. Moments later, his second-generation Mjolnir kit was fully synced with the small flock of TQ-8 seeker drones, each outfitted with a lightweight but high-yield explosive charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the pieces nearly in place, Fireteam Shadow’s operation was ready to begin. After Stone cleared the inner perimeter patrols with help from her active camo module, Kidman’s drones would drop the doors, allowing Stone and Fry to infiltrate and hit the Covenant firebase at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prepared to engage, Fry made one last check with Kovan. “Shadow Two, you’re on overwatch. Keep your new toy primed in case we were wrong about that production run.” Fry paused. “Or in case you need to finish the job. There should be enough firepower there in the event we hit trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That won’t be necessary, Shadow One.” Kovan responded. “If you find trouble, I’ll hit it for you.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Duly noted.” For a split second, the lower contours of Fry’s GOBLIN-class Mjolnir helmet mimicked the smile that had formed on his own face. Partly in amusement from Kovan’s retort, and partly in anticipation of any opportunity to add another blemish to the Covenant’s once-stellar combat record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before he could give the final go-ahead, however, a different voice broke through the team’s comms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Fireteam Shadow, this is Spartan Miller in Ops. I’m filling in for Commander Palmer, so apologies to your team’s handler, uh, Spartan Carmichael, for going over his head here.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fry cursed to himself before opening a channel. “This is Shadow Leader. Go ahead, Miller.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Got a job for you. Infiltrate a Covenant cruiser and destroy her power core. I’m sending you coordinates now.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever reservations Fry might have had on hand were not made remotely apparent. Spartans knew that they fought for priorities often greater than their purview, and that moments lost to protest might ultimately equate to lives lost to the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We can help you out there. Give us a few to get over to those grid squares.” Fry switched to team comms. “Stand down, Shadow. Change of plans.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Define change.” Stone was immediately curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re being diverted. Priority op on a nearby Covenant cruiser.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kidman’s focus turned to a more glaring logistics hurdle. “&lt;em&gt;Cruiser&lt;/em&gt;? That’s going to be in interesting ingress without our limo.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Limo” was the team’s term of endearment for the D79 Pelican dropship that had provided the bulk of their transportation between &lt;em&gt;Infinity &lt;/em&gt;and each subsequent mission across the surface of Requiem. The nature of their mission at the summit necessitated a more delayed and distant LZ to keep the Pelican out of harm’s way when the fireworks started. They were too close to the firebase now to be picked up and no longer had the time to get far enough away. And Fry knew it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Calling an audible, we may just need to grab a rental.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requiem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In position above “Refuge” site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ryn ‘Alun mentally reprimanded himself for the loss of control. Slight though it had been, the absent-minded rubbing of his wrist while on the bridge was an act that might betray his nervous anticipation to his crew. It was unbecoming of a shipmaster to display such feelings, however subtle the motion might be to suggest it. He must always be in control. As an ancient Sangheili proverb taught:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;one who has not mastered the self&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;who has not emerged victorious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;from the battle within their own mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;has no hope of mastering the foes without&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the foes from without had come to claim the home of the gods—a home which was now shared with the worthy. Requiem had become a symbol of everything their revitalized alliance had achieved. They hadn’t just risen above the Covenant of old, they were becoming what it was always meant to be. High Charity seemed a pale imitation compared to the seat of the gods themselves, and this was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Silent Blade, ‘Alun’s own special operations unit of deadly enforcers, had been deployed to Requiem’s Refuge site, where they would no doubt make short work of the humans that were clumsily fumbling with its arcane machinery. Word had come that they had already engaged an increasingly notorious demon squad called &lt;em&gt;Nalsaban&lt;/em&gt;— “Crimson” in the human tongue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had been well over three years since Jul ‘Mdama led his combined fleet to the shield world, where he sought to awaken one of the gods and ask for their aid in the war against the humans. It was only six months ago that they had finally been granted access to its wonders within.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, as ‘Mdama had declared, was actually due to the arrival of a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; vessel, an event which had seemed to interest the warrior-god that had slumbered within this world—the Didact. The humans’ arrival—heralded by the Demon himself—represented a perfect opportunity to test the might and worthiness of the Covenant against their enemy’s greatest hero. And the prospect of pleasing one of their gods in the flesh was one that inflamed the spirit of zeal within their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Didact was now absent, having bequeathed Requiem to the Covenant, and over the last six months they had begun the process of turning this hollow sphere of heaven into their new home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Refuge was a location they had discovered early in their efforts to penetrate the shield world. There they had been, in the warrior-keep chamber, where the lone human awakened the Didact. The Forerunner delivered his judgment, declared the return of the gods, and upon his departure transported the worthy warriors who had fought to the core of his world to this sanctum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You are Sangheili,”&lt;/em&gt; the Didact had said. &lt;em&gt;“Loyal and strong, even in your second form. You will serve well.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was here that ‘Mdama was formally named the Hand of the Didact, and it was here that &lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle&lt;/em&gt; had primarily been stationed to protect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the demons had successfully reconnoitered this site on two occasions, this third incursion was ordered to be the last—a weighty responsibility, and one that Ryn recognized as the source of his anticipation. Ever was he wondering whether his loyalty and strength had served the gods well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Shipmaster,” a bridge officer turned to him. “One of our Phantoms approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Our deployed forces are not meant to return until after the humans have been repelled and the Refuge reclaimed,” Ryn replied. “Hail them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They give no response, Shipmas– they are picking up speed!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Raise the hangar shields!” Ryn ordered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;A slight rumble from within the cruiser told them it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ryn ignited his energy sword and motioned for two guards to follow him, knowing precisely what area of the ship the demons would target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their true test of worthiness had come at last. The Silent Blade would serve the gods well today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requiem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positioned above Site Req//7848-2328&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turned out, getting &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;was the easy part. The Phantom dropship that Fireteam Shadow had commandeered had given them as smooth an entry point as they could have hoped for, but their exploits did little to improve any diplomatic relations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Shadow Four, you got that guided tour ready to go?” Spartan Fry had barely finished the question when the digital ship layout Kidman was readying began to overlay key waypoints and nav markers onto their helmet displays. It would make finding their way through the &lt;em&gt;Canticle &lt;/em&gt;relatively straightforward, but it wouldn’t stem the mounting Covenant resistance pouring into each iridescent indigo passageway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Spartan fireteam moved as a fluid unit through the ship’s interior, each member alternating and coordinating enemy engagements with practiced precision. Stone checked her VISR readout to confirm their location. “Primary reactor chamber isn’t far now. After this next set of doors we’ve got one hallway left.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kidman finished transferring several rounds from his MA5D into the skulls of three Kig-Yar, their needler fire no longer impeding Shadow’s progress. “I’m picking up chatter on native frequencies—localization script is having trouble keeping up with it all but I can tell you that they aren’t exactly happy we’re here.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You needed a translation for that?” Kovan’s reply landed somewhere between dry wit and incredulity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fry brushed aside the sibling-esque squad banter to focus on the task at hand. “Shadow Leader to Spartan Miller.” Fry waited a split second for his helmet’s comms display to confirm signal receipt. “Sorry for the delay, sir. We’re meeting heavy resistance in the cruiser. Seems like they &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;want their spaceship blown up.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only took a moment to get a response. “&lt;em&gt;Understood, Shadow Leader. Keep me informed.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Shadow Three, update on that final corridor?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stone tilted her head to the side as she responded. “The good news is that I do have an update. The bad news is that it’s not good news.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Kidman can translate that if you need.” Kovan interjected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before Fry could offer a leader’s rebuke, Stone continued. “We’ve got enemy targets entering the far side of the corridor, it’s not going to be easy.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Distance?” Fry asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Approximately forty meters.” Stone responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Acknowledged. We enter on my mark. I’ll take point—Nina… call Abbey.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kovan smiled—not at Fry’s use of her own name, but that of her personal sniper rifle. “She’s already on the line.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Spartan fireteam entered the corridor and covered the first several meters in what seemed like an instant, but long enough to confirm Stone’s recon assessment as several Covenant soldiers opened fire at the other end. The tip of the spear, Fry immediately activated a Z-90 PCE, emitting a glowing and imposing hardlight shield in front of the group to stave off the enemy’s opening salvo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Shadow Two, be ready on the drop.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kovan was already looking down Abbey’s sights, eager to answer the call. “Knock-knock.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In what seemed like one singular moment, Fry’s hardlight shield deactivated and four shots rang out, dropping three Kig-Yar and two Unggoy, Kovan using the tighter quarters to her advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fry barked out the next phase. “Stone, go quiet, take the solution, and get ahead of us—we need to get to that core.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The “solution” was a sizable munitions case that contained the device originally meant to be used by Kovan at the summit site. Despite the unexpected change in objective, Fry hoped that it might still prove valuable. He also wasn’t about to leave it behind in enemy hands regardless of the location. Stone grabbed the case, activated her active camo module, and disappeared from sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;After dispatching the remaining resistance, Fry, Kovan, and Kidman emerged from the corridor into the larger chamber that housed the main reactor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it also housed at least a dozen veteran Elite warriors, including one particularly imposing Sangheili sporting a more ornate command harness. A ping on Shadows’ helmet displays highlighted the commander and identified him as Ryn ‘Alun—shipmaster of &lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle&lt;/em&gt; and leader of a Covenant spec-ops group named the Silent Blade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Igniting his energy sword, Ryn ‘Alun crossed the room with rousing battle cry that sent his lieutenants into a frenzy of their own. Plasma and hot lead filled the air a moment later as the two forces clashed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set against a pair of them, it was with a keen awareness that Fry noted that the saurian soldiers moved with a speed and skill that largely matched those of his own Spartans. And while he dispatched the first of his foes in short order, the second proved to be more up to the task. Energy shields shimmered and sizzled as they traded blows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dance couldn’t have lasted more than a few intense moments; gritting against the bruising strength of the Elite, Fry used his bulk to advantage to set the creature toppling over. But the encounter was enough to narrow his focus, to take his mind temporarily off the larger conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would cost him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shipmaster was given a moment he did not waste, a well-timed lunge knocking the fireteam leader off balance and onto the cold floor. When Fry tried to return to his feet, ‘Alun was back over him in an instant, delivering a series of devastating blows to the helmet and torso that put the Spartan back on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vision swimming, Shadow One fought hard against the nauseating darkness that tugged at the edges of his vision, choosing instead to keep his gaze fixed on the shipmaster’s sneer of contempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fry’s failing localization suite tried to make sense of the voice behind the mandibles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[Demon… payment… death…]”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shipmaster’s sword flared to life with his final word and in a single seamless gesture began its descent, the blade primed to pierce armor and augmented heart alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even with his enhanced reflexes, Fry recognized there was no time to change its course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;He braced for the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blow never landed, at least, not where he expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;An invisible force sent the shipmaster stumbling away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stone’s active camo flickered off as she countered the shipmaster’s attack, dropping two primed M9 frag grenades between them to turn Ryn’s offensive lunge into an evading dodge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Fry, we have to move &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;!” Stone barked as she scrambled to get their fireteam leader back on his feet, using the ensuing explosions as cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Where’s our solution?” Fry’s query was strained in the way only broken ribs will incite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“With Nina.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kovan’s location pinged on each Spartan’s VISR as she opened the case to reveal an M6/E Grindell/Galilean Nonlinear Rifle. “Shadow, meet Selene. I think I’m going to like her.” Her almost unsettling glee was tangible even over comms as she finalized the integration protocols to sync her targeting optics with the modified Spartan Laser and primed the first shot. “Don’t tell Abbey.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chamber flashed as the first blast from Kovan’s new toy hit the reactor, accompanied by a howl of despair from the shipmaster before delivering a final command to the surviving Elites that needed no translation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Abandon ship.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reactor core’s hum turned into a higher-pitched whine as Kovan fired another blast and the few remaining Covenant forces scrambled towards their escape pods. “Going somewhere?” Stone remarked as she dropped two of the fleeing Elites, leaving only the shipmaster—but as he rounded a corner, it was clear that they’d lost him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;After three more successive salvos from Kovan, Kidman confirmed the objective’s completion. “Reactor is in runaway overload—now would be a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good time to leave.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fry initiated a comms link back to &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt; as the fireteam regrouped and looked for an exit strategy. “Miller, this is Shadow Leader. Cruiser power core is hit and overload in progress! We’re evac’ing now. Expect a light show within thirty.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Hot damn, good work, Shadow Leader!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of Spartan Miller’s response was interrupted by Kidman. “Shadow One, I’ve got a local lock on a drop bay with empty squad pods—if we hurry, I think we can make it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Those are good enough odds for me, Shadow Four. Nice work.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requiem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jungle region outside “Refuge” site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ryn ‘Alun’s hearts sank as he watched &lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle &lt;/em&gt;shudder and break. The clouds parted as a shockwave rippled outwards, coolant spilled to the ground from its underbelly like blue-green ichor, and a final groaning eruption of purple fire uprooted the vessel’s position, sending it on a collision course with the far-reaching jungles of Requiem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are Sangheili&lt;/em&gt;, the Didact’s words echoed in his head. &lt;em&gt;Loyal and strong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;He &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been loyal—to his brothers, to the Covenant, to the gods… it hadn’t been enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had come here with numbers and might and faith that hadn’t been witnessed in years, and still it took only a handful of these demons to undo it all before their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will serve well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is what the old warrior had meant. To be “tested” as a warrior and not simply be rewarded with victory. True service and sacrifice came through continuing to endure even in defeat—to draw strength not simply from within, but from the spirits of one’s fallen brothers, becoming a vessel of vengeance; demanding blood be spilled for the blood that was lost. And &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; blood had just been lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no doubt in his mind that this was the same fire the demons had themselves been tempered by when their own worlds were burned. It was the same crucible the Covenant had endured after being split asunder, only to be reforged into something new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that moment, Ryn felt he understood what their god had meant. Loyalty and strength were indeed a virtuous foundation, but a warrior must build upon them with &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle&lt;/em&gt; collided with the ground, smoke and fire billowing upwards like a pillar of holy fire, his own became clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would be reforged in this defeat into something new, and he would hunt these Spartans—these “Shadows”—to whatever end it would take him to avenge the fallen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Silent Blade disappeared into the jungle of Requiem, knowing that his time of retribution had only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Panom’s Canticle &lt;/em&gt;broke apart in the Requiem sky, a &lt;em&gt;Gloto’kef&lt;/em&gt;-pattern assault carapace sped away from the wreckage towards the surface, carrying four Spartan-IV super-soldiers. The vehicle’s inertia dampeners kicked in for a surprisingly elegant landing, its four pod doors retracted, and Fireteam Shadow stepped out into a forest clearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miller’s voice urgently crackled over the comm.&lt;em&gt; “Shadow Leader! Was your team clear? Shadow Leader!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re here, &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt;,” Fry confirmed, calm and collected as ever. “And all in one piece.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Excellent work, Spartans,”&lt;/em&gt; Miller relaxed. &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt;’s AI Roland then chimed in, informing him of another situation at Forward Base Magma that Fireteam Crimson was to be redirected to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fry stepped up to his team. “Autopilot retrieval is active,” he marked their position for the Pelican, a small green arrow on their HUD map started moving towards them. “Limo’s on the way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You hear that, Selene?” Kovan removed her helmet and patted the munitions case. “We’ll have a warm meal for you back home in no time.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t make any promises quite yet,” Fry warned. “Just got a new order, apparently Carmichael was feeling left out of all the fun.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stone let out an audible sigh. “Something tells me we aren’t going to make that Valentine’s dance at the atrium park tonight, are we?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Maybe next year.” Kovan smirked. “Don’t tell Abbey.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "content": "\n&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the Master Chief finished the fight against the Prophet of Truth and the Gravemind, escaping extragalactic space with Cortana and Arbiter Thel ‘Vadam aboard the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Forward Unto Dawn&lt;/em&gt;. Unseen forces conspired to send the &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; to a new destination, resulting in the Arbiter making it back to Earth while the Chief and Cortana were sequestered in the vessel’s severed aft section as it drifted towards a mysterious Forerunner shield world, and we were left to wonder what new fight loomed over the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;That question would be answered in &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, the debut mainline title entry from 343 Industries, which released November 6, 2012. Ten years ago to this day…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been ten years since we made landfall on Requiem and awakened the Didact, who unleashed his army of Prometheans as he sought to find the Composer to imprison humanity within his deadly war machines. Ten years since Cortana, struggling with the debilitating condition of rampancy, sacrificed herself to go out on her own terms, save Earth, and send the Master Chief back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten years since weekly Spartan Ops episodes with Dr. Halsey’s manipulative shenanigans as we protected eggheads from hinge-heads. Ten years since BTB on Exile, since the debut of Mantis stomp (and victory crouch), since Dominion on Longbow, Ace vs Pistola, Flagsassinations, leaked camcorder footage of multiplayer matches recorded on VHS tapes in barns…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten years since &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we mark this milestone and look ever forwards to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s future, we thought we’d gather some folks from the studio to reminisce about what &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; means to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some of you may remember Halo Fest 2011 where, on our journey towards Requiem, we teased &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; with a concept art trailer. Today, we return to Requiem once more with an anniversary video to see how that concept art was realized into a stunning new game world for the Xbox 360, accompanied by Neil Davidge’s haunting score “Legacy,” capturing the ethereal, mythic tragedy of the Forerunners through Claire Tchaikowsky’s soul-rending vocal performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"&gt;\n&lt;iframe title=\"Return to Requiem | Halo 4&apos;s Tenth Anniversary\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2wrJ_Tv1kQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KIKI WOLFKILL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is at once hard to put into words how profound the experience of building &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was and at the same time, there are not enough words. Life-changing experiences always feel very close because of their weight and import and lingering resonance; it’s hard to believe it has already been ten years since the release of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, as the memory of it feels so fresh and runs so deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of the Master Chief on the outer hull of the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn\" class=\"wp-image-48989\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Dawn-Chief-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I could pick just one aspect of the &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; development experience to talk about, especially as it was so beautifully intertwined with the creation of 343 Industries itself. Would it be getting to be part of an incredibly talented team from all over the world and every game background, and together building a new studio? Was it the experience of being in the trenches with an extraordinary group of individuals and together creating something we all deeply believed in? Or was it having the opportunity to tell the next chapter in Master Chief and Cortana’s story, two characters I grew up with and had always loved?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say, but I can definitively state that the process of building &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was one of the most beautiful, challenging, and gratifying experiences I’ve had the good fortune to be involved with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The seeds of 343 were a newly formed group of best-in-class artists (audio-included) and designers and engineers who left their jobs and homes to move to Seattle to do the seemingly impossible: take on the mantle from Bungie, the master originators of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;. It was an effort fueled by a pure love for the &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;games and universe, and the belief that it could and should have a place in the pantheon of cultural entertainment icons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, we were chartered with building a startup studio and with that, defining the culture that would be responsible for caretaking &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;. It was a time of incredible excitement and energy, breathless creativity and ingenuity, and not a little bit of fear. We were going to set out to do what many believed could not be done… build a new &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;game with a new team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of the Master Chief gazing out at the floating spires of Requiem\" class=\"wp-image-49143\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Requiem-Chief-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never held so much inspiration, ambition, belief, and anxiety together in my head and heart at the same time, but watching the team come together and heroically battle every day to create an experience we felt was worthy of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; was&lt;em&gt; pure magic&lt;/em&gt;. I can only begin to express the depth of talent and passion this group represented, many of whom are also contributing to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We learned many hard lessons, some of them through the course of development that we were able to correct, some after we released and could only correct in subsequent releases. We added a new enemy class—the Prometheans—and through that we learned the challenges of balancing the intent of new sandbox behaviors with the expectations of an already exceptionally crafted classic sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We strove to bring new gameplay elements to what was already beloved, and we brought a creative vision unique to our talent, to a universe we all loved and respected. We collaborated with new visual and audio artists, as well as those who had been with &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; since the beginning, to express new &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; worlds such as Requiem and the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Infinity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of a Promethean Knight\" class=\"wp-image-49115\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Promethean-Knight-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And nearest to my heart, we continued Master Chief’s arc, working to express his hero’s journey through themes of duty and sacrifice, and ultimately through his relationship with one of his closest friends, Cortana. Through &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, we learned to make &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some, &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; is amongst their favorite &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games, and for others, it falls further down the list. I still love &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; not just for the game that it is and the story it told, but also because of the journey it took us on to make it. There was a purity of intent and drive to create something that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans would love because all of us were &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;has always been about having hope in the darkest of times, overcoming adversity in the face of the impossible, epic stakes, and most of all, about heroes. In creating a game where we hoped to express all of these things, it seemed only fitting that we also experienced them ourselves, which made the journey all the more special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEIL DAVIDGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago already… wow, it really doesn’t seem that long, although my son will be ten in December so I should have twigged that it was coming up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve actually just introduced him to the world of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;—he and I have been working our way through each of the campaigns, plus he loves Forge. We’re currently playing &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; and having an awesome time. He seems immensely proud to find that his dad is actually a “gamer,” much more so than being a music maker it seems…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, next on our list is &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m kind of nervous about playing it, a project that meant a lot to me, music I poured my heart into and struggled to get out at times. A project where I met and got to work with so many brilliant and inspiring people that I still miss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The Didact and Librarian meet for a discussion outside the council chamber halls of Maethrillian\" class=\"wp-image-49857\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-Maethrillian-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a newcomer to scoring games it was quite a challenge to get with the process, the traditional constructs of narrative in film don’t really apply, although as much as I could, I tried to compose thematically. But I did miss having the visual to vibe against. It was hard, I’m a visually led composer, even something as simple as the lighting of a space will change how I score a scene and what instrumentation I go with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I took whatever info I could (stills, the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; books, and of course the previous games) and built that visual world inside my head for each of the characters. I tried to inhabit them and write from each of their perspectives, kind of inside out, beginning with their internal feelings and questions, and then arranging on top to meet the scale of the world that each character lived within.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The piece ‘Legacy’ very much followed that way of thinking. Imagining the Forerunners, their culture, politics, art, imagining them debating in a great hall of glass and of light, these impassioned old souls and voices exchanging great ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The Forerunner council gathered at Maethrillian to discuss their war with humanity in Halo 4&apos;s Terminals\" class=\"wp-image-49171\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Maethrillian-Council-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d previously had a conversation with Sotaro Tojima (Tajeen) and Ken Kato about finding a unique choral sound for &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, moving to a new soundscape beyond the Gregorian sound that Marty had established in the first game. They suggested I listen to some traditional Bulgarian female choral music, which I did and was immediately inspired. I loved the power and passion, that full throated sound felt earthy whilst at the same time regal. It seemed a fitting place to start in finding a sound for the Forerunners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original piece I played on synths with a traditional choir sample library to work out the melody. It didn’t sound that great at first, I couldn’t get the phrasing right at all with the samples, but in my head I knew how it could sound. It really came together when I asked vocalist Claire Tchaikowski to help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Claire and I listened to a bunch of traditional songs and I tried to sing how I imagined it to be phrased. As it turned out though, she was very familiar with this style of singing from listening to the Kate Bush album “The Sensual World,” and in particular the track “Rocket’s Tail,” which featured a Bulgarian choir, so she instantly got what I was reaching for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we didn’t simply want random vocal sounds, it was important to give the song meaning, but using an “Earth” language wouldn’t make sense. So, we first needed to create an “alien language” and write lyrics for the piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Claire is multilingual, speaking fluent English and French, and with a reasonable handle of Italian, German and Spanish. This was invaluable, we could have found someone to create a language, but it needed to be a language that felt poetic when sung. Claire could sing the “words” as they came to her so we could fine tune how they would sound and how they would more importantly feel in their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The “words” needed to feel important and have gravity to them. It took a while longer to come up with the words than it did the melody, but it was worth it. This eventually became our idea for a traditional language for the Forerunners, in much the same way that Latin is a traditional language but not spoken in modern everyday life. This “language” also came to be the basis for the pieces “Revival” and “Nemesis.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of the Ur-Didact\" class=\"wp-image-49059\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The initial idea was that Claire would record the demo, and once (if…) the piece was approved we would record it with the London Bulgarian Choir here in the UK, but it was instantly clear to me that Claire had nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with the main vocal line, she had recorded all the individual choir parts and harmonies, with some improvised from the original sketch I did and taken much further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she sang there was a sense of a great story being told because, in her mind, that’s exactly what she was singing about. We had talked at length about the Forerunners, who they were. I’d read as much as I could about them and gotten as much background from 343 as I could. She sang of their culture, history, science, romance… their greatest achievements and losses. She put her heart and soul into that song. I couldn’t imagine how anyone could possibly touch her performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a pastiche of Bulgarian, it was unique, it was &lt;em&gt;Forerunner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"The Didact embracing the Librarian, his wife, in the Halo 4 Terminals\" class=\"wp-image-49073\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Librarian-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end I did ask the London Bulgarian choir to add their voices to enhance the scale of sound. They’re tucked away in the background, but Claire was very much the focus—her tracked up voices adding a quality, an “otherness,” that we couldn’t have achieved with a traditional choir.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept the various drones, sonics and tones I’d created with synths and my Kantele (very processed, played with an ebow and Cello bow) from the original demo. Then added the orchestra which Andrew Morgan and I arranged and recorded at Abbey Road studios along with the rest of the score. I also did some processing of the voices, I wanted it to sound like the performance itself was a memory, almost like those old recordings of songs from WWII, except it was from a digital age (which of course wouldn’t be affected by time but hey, some artistic license please…)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, Andy Bradfield in London mixed the now finished arrangement. He and I went back and forth a little trying to realize the sound I had in my head, but as with everyone on this project, Andy brought his own individual passion to the piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now… as my son and I are about to dive into &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, this piece particularly is poignant, because unknown (I think…) to all at 343 at the time, Claire and I weren’t simply collaborating in a musical sense, but our shared love for music… music being what had brought us together… had become a love for each other too, and so, our son was and is, quite literally… a child of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy 10th birthday &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, and happy 10th birthday Elliott.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAN CHOSICH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We worked our asses off. It legitimately felt like we were trying to make our stamp on the world. We were all bound together by this hope that we could pull off something that could stand next to Bungie’s &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;games. I am such a massive fan of those original games, how they were marketed, and what they inspired. My job was to create all our internal marketing: ViDocs, game trailers, some of our bigger promotional beats like E3 trailers for MP and in theater featurettes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I joined the studio they bought some old Panasonic cameras, a DSLR, and a light. I kept the light and the DSLR. Then I started to document the making of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;. I got more equipment as time went on, but this started a long journey of being let into some very private rooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first, most inviting, experiences was going to document the creation of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;’s music in Bristol, England. I spent weeks with Neil Davidge and Tajeen. Neil and his team ended up being like family. The same was true for the audio team at 343. We spent so much time together that I grew a deep affinity for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"&gt;\n&lt;iframe title=\"Making Halo 4: Composing Worlds\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmfGsuOacMA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In writing terms, the studio didn’t yet have its ‘voice.’ It needed a North Star. The earliest North Star ended up being the music. It was very atmospheric and synth-y. There was this rhythm of color that the music created. Almost as if you closed your eyes, pops of color could emit and inspire. It wasn’t finished, but it was something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see and hear a lot of this in the first ‘concept art’ trailer that was released for &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;. That was the tone and mood that was being set at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"&gt;\n&lt;iframe title=\"Halo Fest: Halo 4 Concept Art Glimpse\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vAKmu2yn3Fk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I go back and think about &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of what I think about is the music. It was such a unique and affecting experience for me. To (literally) stand in middle of the room while the best musicians in the world are playing &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; music is something that goes down to the bones. It’s such a powerful force. I so desperately wanted to share that with the team because it blew me away. It gave me such hope that we were going to make something great because the music alone was resounding emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was all of this concept art, there were all of these great artists, producers and engineers, but they had never taken one thing to a roughly shippable state. All of us were looking at this with huge eyes and sinking stomachs. There was this spirit of wanting to prove something to ourselves. Even though it was Microsoft, we felt like underdogs. The tech was not well documented, the team never worked together, but somehow it came together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With sheer talent comes a lot of personalities and a lot of tension. People were tired, stressed, overworked. It was the kind of scenario you wouldn’t wish on someone—but there were these moments where the public saw what 343 were doing and they began to believe. One of the biggest moments of &lt;em&gt;“Oh, I think we can pull this off”&lt;/em&gt; was E3 2012. People saw the game, played Spartan Ops, and saw that 343 had the team to take on this monumental challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"&gt;\n&lt;iframe title=\"Halo 4 at E3 2012\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sscCrd7i2Ek?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time I knew we were making something amazing was when we created the first ViDoc for &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;My permanent seat was next to the audio team and we’d get builds of the game delivered on Xbox 360 dev kits. I remember myself and Paul Featherstone loaded up the third mission, “Forerunner.” The rocks in that level blew my mind. &lt;em&gt;The ROCKS!&lt;/em&gt; That was the first exterior environment that was just mind blowing to me. It felt next generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember taking the game camera and inputting a bunch of legacy code to create a depth of field effect, then translating the camera along the ground. As I did this, our engineering lead stopped in his tracks and said, “Holy shit, I can’t believe our game looks this good!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"&gt;\n&lt;iframe title=\"Halo 4: A Hero Awakens Behind the Scenes\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3KLtf8DzCU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can keep typing but the reality is that 343 was an idea before &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;. It was a publishing arm that was helping to support &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;. It was doing interesting things in different windows and spaces, but those endeavors were finite and outsourced. &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; turned 343 into a team. &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; turned 343 into a studio. 343 was more an idea before that and &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was the game that aimed to say: “We make &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, personally, always had a bit of mixed feelings about it. We didn’t make &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, we &lt;em&gt;took on Halo&lt;/em&gt;. 343 used to say, “We are the custodians of the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; franchise.” I think that’s the most accurate definition. We shepherd it. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; isn’t owned by one given thing anymore, it’s a collection of ideas and experiences that live in people’s heads. Those memories and those shared experiences are so important to uphold and preserve—but at some point, you do need new memories that can become touchpoints for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORRINNE ROBINSON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was an exciting time at 343 because it was an era of possibility. We were working on the first new &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game from 343 and it was going to have new enemy types and a new look. We were working on new novels that explored the ancient era of the Forerunners 100,000 years ago and the post-Covenant War era with Kilo-5. We got to celebrate &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with fans at the very first Halo Fest in 2011 (including a &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; panel which had some sneak peeks).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this time, we were also in production on &lt;em&gt;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&lt;/em&gt; and getting ready to film and launch our first live action offering to the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Cover art of the novels Halo: Cryptum and Halo: Glasslands\" class=\"wp-image-49003\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Cryptum-Glasslands-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&lt;/em&gt; was magical to work on and I am super-proud of the final product. It was a small production, so 343 had great connections and a direct line to the entire crew. The director and assistant director were both big &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans and they worked together to think through how each scene would play out if it were actually within the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe. The production was filmed in Vancouver, Canada, utilizing Simon Fraser University as part of the fictional campus for the ‘Corbulo Academy of Military Science.’&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being headquartered in Washinton state, we were close enough to go up and see things in-person which was a huge benefit. Getting to be in on the ground floor of a production like this where you get to see the amazing set designs and costumes as concepts, and then the care taken in the progression to lift them straight off the paper to become fully immersive, filmable pieces was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;and have not seen &lt;em&gt;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&lt;/em&gt; yet, it’s worth a watch! In fact, if you’re looking for an entry point into some of the expanded universe elements of the franchise, this is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image of Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn live-action series\" class=\"wp-image-49087\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-FUD-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;One other memory I have from &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was working on the limited-edition console. Sometimes the limited editions are confined to the color or design on the outside of each unit—and maybe a sound for the power button… For &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, it was the end of the 360 generation, so they let us experiment and try things that normally would not be on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using transparent materials, painting on the inside and outside of the console, and using metallics all had to be tested and approved. Changing the classic green Xbox light to blue was the final touch to make it look more like &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and it ended up being a really unique console befitting a really unique game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Halo 4 Limited Edition Xbox 360 console\" class=\"wp-image-49031\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-LE-Console-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLENN ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evolution is always a controversial topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; followed the gradual model for me; it was a continuation of the work I’d done on &lt;em&gt;ODST&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt;, specifically where the Covenant aesthetic was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of a Covenant Zealot\" class=\"wp-image-49157\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Zealot-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw it as an opportunity to take aspects of their identity that were in the fiction, but as-yet unexplored in the experience, and make them &lt;em&gt;visible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea that Covenant “technology” is often nothing more than a skin, literally grown around a revered (if poorly understood) Forerunner core. That Covenant “culture” is schismatic, rife with dispute, not just between species but between creeds. That Covenant “history” is a lie, a series of myths and deliberate misinterpretations of events meant to manipulate its believers without question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my mind, &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; asked “What would it look like if all of this went out of control?” and in response the Hand of the Didact was born. The Covenant &lt;em&gt;evolved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Spartan Ops cinematic screenshot of Jul &apos;Mdama\" class=\"wp-image-49101\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Jul-Mdama-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an ambitious direction to take but it felt like a natural one, to steer these few Elites and their followers away from their noble bearing and physique, to make their weapons and armor overgrown, to make them wilder and more threatening in every way. Animals, not warriors—monsters to fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt like a bold but focused incremental progression, a means to show as well as tell the story we intended as comprehensively and viscerally as we could. We were stoked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was gradual to us felt too punctuated to many upon release, of course, but ten years on seems like the right time to clear the air. Despite the rumors written then, there was no drive nor demand to reinvent for reinvention’s sake, no “hate” for the legacy, and nothing to prove but this—we understood the mantle of responsibility we had taken on, and we&lt;em&gt; loved&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; as much as you. Ten years on, we still do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am as proud today of the work we did on &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; as I ever was for &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; before, or &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; since, and I’m truly glad that you’re still here to evolve with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAVID ELLIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was a project of discovery. We pulled hundreds of the most talented people from around the world together and said, “Hey, go make a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game.” We didn’t know what we didn’t know. That was sometimes a blessing AND a curse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 Spartan Ops in-game screenshot of Requiem&apos;s Apex vista\" class=\"wp-image-49185\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Anvils-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who were here, it’s hard to forget the words “Stable M7.” I can’t say enough amazing things about the engineering team that took on the gargantuan task of integrating the final &lt;em&gt;Reach &lt;/em&gt;engine drop into our in-progress development environment. Their work on this project was truly “space magic.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were regularly figuring things out as we went along, so staying in constant contact with the team around you was key. This led to some long-lasting relationships that continue today for those of us who were in the trenches for &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite period was showing off the whole game for the first time at E3 2012. From kicking off the Xbox Showcase to feeling the energy on the show floor, that experience elevated everyone on the project’s energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The excitement of the fans carried the team all the way to launch. I remember getting the chance to hang out with Neil Davidge one night during the show, talking for hours about the creative process and what we liked best about creating. He had no reason to be that gracious or kind to someone who was just a junior designer at the time, but I’ll always appreciate his generosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREGORY MURPHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Spartan Ops it was really exciting to experiment with different game rules and encounters than the campaign but with the same sandbox. To build multiple encounters and progression on the same level was great creative fun because of the challenge. It was exciting to have a different storyline from campaign with more points of view and characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 Spartan Ops in-game screenshot of Phantoms flying inside Requiem at night\" class=\"wp-image-49213\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Phantoms-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, we had a few of us sitting together making content for it. There was great creative “synergy.” We had fun inside jokes and feel-good pranks, like hiding the CD and the “hamburger” candy on desks and waiting for people to find them. The CD that made it to the library inside a library book and then the library calling Kevin Schmitt about the “lost” CD being a great memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEVIN SCHMITT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember interviewing for 343 shortly after the announcement of the Reclaimer Saga. I tried to get as much information as I could during my all-day interview, but everybody was tight lipped and only repeated what had been said to the press. I mean, I knew it was &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, but beyond that, no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my first day, I met up with Greg Murphy and Brad Welch, and they sat me down and explained we were going to work on this little side thing they called “Spartan Ops.” I’m not even sure if it was officially called that back then. The only thing they had was a loose collection of possible locations to be reused for small replayable encounters. Greg had engineered a new way to create waves with a small set of rules and we got to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 Spartan Ops in-game screenshot of a Grunt gesturing towards a Pelican dropship\" class=\"wp-image-49241\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had always been a fan of narrative driven games, so I was always looking for ways to add more story to these missions. Little bits of lore here and there… we didn’t really have a budget for this at all, but I kept adding things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon it started to take on its own life. We brought in a couple of narrative designers to help us craft the story and implement the cinematics for the intros and outros. The long days sitting around the big conference room table at the old 343 building and coming up with ways to tie it into the lore were so much fun. Like Greg said, we had a little bit more freedom to stretch beyond the main story from &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, narratively and gameplay wise. What If we have a level that was just a ton of Watchers that spawned in all over? What if we had a level that was mainly Phantoms and we put power weapons all over the map? We had a lot of fun just coming up with all the quick and crazy scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those Axis Cutscenes?! I remember seeing the rough cuts of those and thinking how cool they were. And then I remember a couple of execs sort of yelling at us that we ended up doubling the budget for Spartan Ops or something. Lol. But it was all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got to show some of the missions off at a few trade shows and I still have my “&lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, Majestic 04” nameplate from one of the stations at PAX.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate.jpg\" alt=\"PAX 2012 Majestic nameplate\" class=\"wp-image-49269\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate-300x291.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate-1024x992.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate-768x744.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate-1536x1488.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Majestic-Nameplate-1568x1519.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a small break, and then it was back to work on the second half of the season. That was particularly challenging because we had shipped &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; and the majority of the studio had left to take time off. We pretty much had our run of the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, near Christmas break, we were trying to fix a 4-player bug, but there were literally only 3 people in the studio… I think it was David, Greg, and myself. One poor employee came in to pick something up and we ended up talking them into staying for a few hours to test the game with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being able to play with the rules a bit like we did was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 Spartan Ops in-game screenshot of a Grunt screaming while running away from a Pelican dropship&apos;s surprise appearance\" class=\"wp-image-49255\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Spartan-Ops-Unggoy-Run-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah, that Library story Greg told was true. We had all thought that CD was lost so imagine my surprise when the library called to tell me the “good news” that they found it. I’m not even sure who put it in there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, forgot about this… when we moved offices to Redmond, back in 2016, I remember finding one of the gummy hamburgers in my stuff when I was packing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s always been about the journey more than the destination, and &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was wonderous and challenging, as well as a huge moment of growth in my career that I will always be proud of. Sharing launch night with our fans and seeing the love for this universe is something that I always carry with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOOKING FOURWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out tomorrow for the arrival of a new online short story on Halo Waypoint, following Fireteam Shadow as they embark on a daring mission to destroy a Covenant cruiser during the events of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;‘s Spartan Ops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who tuned into Canon Fodder LIVE at the Halo World Championship event on October 23, you no doubt caught the announcement of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Epitaph&lt;/em&gt;, the next &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; novel by author Kelly Gay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a particularly special announcement as it explores the continuation of the Didact’s story in the aftermath of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo: Escalation&lt;/em&gt;, and we’ll be doing a round-up of information about this in our next written issue of Canon Fodder later this week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of the Didact reaching out\" class=\"wp-image-49297\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Didact-Composer-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future of &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; as part of &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve got a number of exciting things being cooked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, mod tools. We’ve been gradually providing mod support for each successive title, and &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; is next on that list. As ever, we can’t wait to see what this enables folks to alter and create!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be implementing new skulls to the game, namely Acrophobia and Bandana, along with golden moa collectibles in the campaign and some legacy multiplayer perks that haven’t yet come to MCC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo 4 in-game screenshot of the Master Chief and Cortana\" class=\"wp-image-49129\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/H4-Reclaimer-Chief-Cortana-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theater mode is a beloved feature for &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans. Ever since it shipped in &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt;, it’s been a tool for the community to take and share cool screenshots, but it also allows us to delve into more of the details of various level spaces and environments that you don’t always get to fully appreciate when in the midst of a frantic gunfight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, saving perhaps the best news for last, &lt;em&gt;drumroll please&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking to get Theater mode operational for both the &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; Campaign and Spartan Ops for all players!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when will these things be coming? Some are due to arrive later this month with the November MCC content update, while others are a little further down the road.

This is a huge moment that’s been years in the making and we can’t wait to put our most powerful editing and creative tools into the hands of the &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forge will technically be launching as a “Beta,” but rest assured that it’s still incredibly powerful with immense functionality that will continue to improve and evolve over time. And don’t let the “Beta” moniker fool you—this free update will be permanently added to the game for everyone. Once it’s here, it’s here to stay (along with all the content being created).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we count down the final days to release, we’ve put together answers to some community frequently asked questions (FAQ) and rounded up all the information to date to make sure you know what to expect when the Forge Beta arrives on November 8.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/SAwEbD5qNG8\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;what can I make and how do I make it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/sgIxew1x12s\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Scripting &amp; Bots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;what is scripting, how can I use it, and how can I test my map with bots?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/uyKLrBs6GDM\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: Lighting &amp; Audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;what lighting, art, and audio tools can make my maps look and sound great?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Ea5Mpv0xPVA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4: File Sharing &amp; Canvases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;where can I build my maps and how can people discover them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge.jpg\" alt=\"Header image for the Halo Infinite Forge series showing a Monitor\" class=\"wp-image-45890\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/09/HaloInfiniteForge-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORGE BETA FAQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement of the Forge Beta, you’ve had questions—lots of ‘em! While the Forge Fundamentals series did offer a lot of insights, there’s still no shortage of questions across the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below is a collection of frequently asked questions gathered from Twitter with answers provided by Michael “Forge Lord” Schorr, Forge Lead at 343 Industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will 343 be adding community maps into matchmaking regularly? How easy/difficult is that to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want to do this as soon as possible but it will take a bit of time. It first requires content to be created by the community. Then, 343 needs to identify that content and work with the author(s) to make sure that content meets our functional requirements (works as expected, performs well, etc). Once the content has been finalized, we then need to add it to a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do have plans for a Forge playlist that highlights only community created content. We’re eager to see how the community embraces Forge and will look for opportunities to continue evolving our approach to Forge content in Matchmaking as warranted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When does The Pit hit matchmaking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pit remake is targeted to land in Matchmaking before the end of the year, with other official legacy map remakes planned for further down the road. We’ll have more details to share later, but in the meantime, we expect no shortage of awesome throwback community-creations that could also make their way into Matchmaking (per the question above).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do you think you’ll consider Forge out of Beta? Is it based on performance or the amount of content in the mode?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the Beta label means that we still want to apply more polish and bug fixing to some aspects of the experience in addition to seeing what new issues and opportunities may arise as we release Forge into the wild at massive scale. Forge is an incredibly robust and ambitious feature, and while the team has spent years developing and iterating on it, nothing can truly equal the level of feedback and data we’ll get from players around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also some work that just missed the November 8 Forge launch that we’d like to add before we consider removing the Beta tag. There’s a lot to dig into here—exponentially more so than any prior Forge—but we have more we want to get to including functionality to allow editing on dev maps (at launch, the Forge Beta functionality is centered around the 6 shipping canvases), audio acoustic fidelity improvements, and of course more content (including additional palettes).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any ideas of implementing an “import geo” type thing into &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, so we could create custom assets in Maya/Blender or whatever DCC we’re using and be able to import them into infinite to use in forge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are content moderation and Forge object integration challenges in officially supporting this type of content. That said, we are looking at MCC’s approach to modding support as inspiration and will be listening to the mod community to better understand how to best support them. Who knows what the future will bring, but safe to say November 8 is merely the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I permit others to make copies of my maps, will those copies restart at version number 1 and be saved separate from my own, or will theirs be alternate versions of my own map in my own version count lineup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cloned assets do not include all the versions of the original; they behave as brand-new assets except that map credits persist from the original to the clone. There is no limit on the number of versions an asset can have but non-locked versions are auto-deleted after 30 days. To prevent this type of deletion players can lock asset versions in the Version History menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History.png\" alt=\"Halo Infinite menu screenshot showing version history\" class=\"wp-image-49656\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History.png 3840w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History-300x169.png 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History-1024x576.png 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History-768x432.png 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History-1536x864.png 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Version-History-1568x882.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will there be any basic tutorials on how to Forge and will that happen through The Academy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our Forge Fundamentals video series is a nice overview of the (ahem) Forge Fundamentals and a great launch pad for your Forge journey. We also recommend chatting with any of the Forge community groups out there (Halo Waypoint forums, ForgeHub, The Scripters Guild); they’re supportive, positive, and a great way to meet like-minded folks who are passionate about Forge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll do our best to continue to surface and promote these great community resources and look forward to partnering with the Forge community to help enhance the experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it possible to add campaign AI in Forge? Are y’all working on it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s possible and we are working on how to best bring those features from our internal tools into Forge at a later date. We see a lot of potential in allowing players to create experiences that lean into the cooperative/PVE space. Good news is that with the addition of Nav Mesh and the support of AI controlled Bots, we’ve already got a head start on pushing further into this area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re not announcing anything today and this is long lead work, but it’s definitely an opportunity we’re interested in and excited to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will custom game modes made using Forge’s new visual scripting be able to be shared independently from the maps they were created on as custom game modes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;At launch, any mode logic created using Node Graph will need to be contained within a map by using a script brain. That said, players can create prefabs that contain script brains and related mode objects to share with map makers. This will make it easier to integrate custom modes into maps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Longer term, we have plans to allow mode makers to create custom modes using the Node Graph and share them just like you’d share a custom mode created in the custom game mode editor. This will remove the need to embed ANY mode logic in the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I download maps from other people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Players can use the Community tab to find custom content to play. 343 will also be featuring cool community content in the “Recommended” menu and popular maps, modes, and prefabs will show up in their respective menus. You can then set up a custom game with that content to play with friends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once Season 3 lands, you will also be able to find active games in progress via a Custom Game Browser. And, as noted up above, we’ll also be working to integrate suitable Forge content into Matchmaking over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for additional ways to find and share content!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo Infinite \"Community\" tab menu\" class=\"wp-image-49670\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Community-Tab-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you be looking at or taking submissions for maps to be added to the HCS rotation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll be looking far and wide for cool community made experiences to promote in our “Recommended” section and add to our playlists. &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; had a couple of amazing Forge maps make it into HCS rotation (Fissure, Echelon, and Refuge) and we see the potential for that to happen again. Of course, the maps would need to be tested and iterated on thoroughly before making their way into rotation, but we fully expect that some of the maps made in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s Forge will have what it takes to make into the HCS eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the team does have plans to incorporate Argyle and the Pit remake—both built from the ground up in Forge—to the HCS lineup as a first step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will we see the Custom Game Browser?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s Custom Game Browser will land with Season 3 “Echoes Within” on March 7. Until then, you can find, bookmark, and play custom games on maps and modes that you find in the Content Browser or by looking at an individual’s files. If you’re LFG to play Forge customs with, jump into the Official Halo Discord Server or the Halo Waypoint forums and send up a flare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many players can Forge on the same map at once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up to eight players can Forge together in an active co-forging session. If you want additional players to collaborate with on an asset, you can add them via the Manage Collaborators menu. Just make sure any potential collaborators are friends; you both must be following each other to work together like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that because of a bug we found close to launch, join-in-progress will be disabled for Forge sessions. This means co-forging will require everyone to enter the Forge session at the same time. Fixing this is a top priority for us and will be done as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators.png\" alt=\"Halo Infinite menu for managing collaborators\" class=\"wp-image-49698\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators.png 3840w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators-300x169.png 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators-1024x575.png 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators-768x432.png 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators-1536x863.png 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators-2048x1151.png 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Manage-Collaborators-1568x881.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will we ever get Banished/Covenant structures en masse like Forerunner/Human pieces?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are currently adding more objects to the Forerunner object set and will then move to creating the Banished palette. Other design palettes (Flood, Covenant) are top of mind, but we have not finalized plans for those yet. We understand how much variety and flexibility these sets bring to Forge creations and will add more as fast as we can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we make Custom Power Ups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes! In Node Graph players can place an “On Custom Powerup Used” event node and hookup any scripts they want to it. When someone uses that custom equipment, it’ll fire whatever scripts they have attached. So, players could apply a Trait Set that boosts movement speed and reload times. Or they could refill 50% of the player’s ammo. Players could make Fusion Coils fall from the sky at a point 20 feet in front of where the player is looking. The sky’s the limit. Players can also define weapon combos (like an AR that shoots Skewer ammo!) to really spice things up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup.jpg\" alt=\"In-game Forge menu showcasing custom equipment set-up\" class=\"wp-image-49684\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup.jpg 1777w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup-300x290.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup-1024x989.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup-768x742.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup-1536x1483.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Object-Setup-1568x1514.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1777px) 100vw, 1777px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph.png\" alt=\"Halo Infinite Forge menu showing custom equipment node graph\" class=\"wp-image-49712\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph.png 3840w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph-300x169.png 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph-1024x576.png 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph-768x432.png 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph-1536x864.png 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Custom-Equipment-Node-Graph-1568x882.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say you’ll add more features once Forge is released. What features do you plan to add later on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, the team is focused on supporting the Forge Beta launch. Once we go live, here are the highly requested features we will be diving deeper into:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing on dev maps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minigame game mode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI spawning tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will also be continuing our dialogue with the Forge community and integrating bug fixes, quality of life updates, content drops, and feature work based on that feedback. And, as noted above, we’re also actively working on additional palette offerings for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If possible, can we get more info on how it works when I download a map from someone, and they update it later? Would it download the changes as an update? Or do I need to manually download the new version? (By extension what about prefabs people made as well if they are updated?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you bookmark a map, you are bookmarking that map asset. If the player updates and publishes the map at a later date, the bookmark will point at the newest published version. Prefabs work differently—every time a player publishes a prefab it’s treated as a new asset. So, if you’ve bookmarked a prefab and the creator of that prefab publishes an update to that prefab, your bookmarked prefab still points to the version of the prefab you originally bookmarked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Halo Infinite Forge menu showing copy protection\" class=\"wp-image-49726\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Asset-Details-Copy-Protection-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the maps we create during the Forge Beta carry over when it leaves the “Beta” state?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once Forge is out of Beta, all content created during the Beta phase will absolutely be supported in future updates. Invalidating player content is a total deal breaker for us, so we consider this with everything we add to Forge going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the team’s future plans for audio features in Forge? Are there plans to include triggering music or VO from the Campaign?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of audio, we are currently focused on improving\nacoustic fidelity in Forge. In an effort to reduce the amount of manual work on\nplayers when creating Forge maps, we employ a simplified version of the\nacoustics system. Because of these differences, audio traveling between\ndifferent rooms will not be as muffled as in dev maps. Improvements in this\narea are in the works for a future update. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ability to trigger VO lines in Forge is something we have discussed though and is definitely on our wishlist—it’s easy to see how cool it would be to create your own mode and trigger iconic Steitzer lines! Music trigger functionality is in a similar situation—no current plans but also something we know would be cool and it’s on our wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you plan to add water features at some point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we are currently discussing the best way to bring placeable water into Forge. No other details to share at the moment but it’s clear that this functionality is very important to the Forge community!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed you refer to Forge as a game engine rather than a map editor. When did it become clear that the next evolution of Forge would have to be the development of a game engine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the start, our goal was to create a version of Forge that was as close as possible to our internal tools. Early on in Forge’s development, we had this Tom French quote guiding our vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you give them a toy, they’ll make toys. If you give them a tool, they’ll make experiences.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on what we’ve seen of the community and Forge Council creations so far, we feel like we are well on our way to delivering on that promise!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any rules or restrictions around creating Forge content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The use of our games and services is governed by the &lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Microsoft Services Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (MSA) which you should definitely familiarize yourself with before you start creating and sharing content (please pay attention to the Code of Conduct within the MSA as well). The &lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/community-standards?xr=footnav\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Xbox Community Standards&lt;/a&gt; also apply to anything and everything you do within &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORGEWARD UNTO DAWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can’t wait to release the Forge Beta on November 8 and usher in an exciting future for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; where the community itself is at the center, leading us all forward into brand new experiences of all shapes and sizes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll keep our eyes out for more community questions to update this article but also suggest you join the &lt;a href=\"https://forums.halowaypoint.com/\"&gt;Halo Waypoint Forums&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"http://discord.gg/Halo\"&gt;Official Halo Discord&lt;/a&gt; to meet and share with fellow Forgers.

However, we know that some folks want more control over their latency, so (as we discussed in a previous post) we’re working to give you that control. To that end, &lt;strong&gt;we’ve added a new feature that allows players to choose to match exclusively into games hosted within their local region.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This option can be found in the settings, under Gameplay-&gt;Matchmaking-&gt;Search Region. The default is “Expanded”, which is the existing behavior: we try to match you in your region but will allow matches outside. &lt;strong&gt;Changing the setting to “local” will limit your matches just to your region.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080.jpg\" alt=\"A settings screen showing the local region matchmaking feature.\" class=\"wp-image-49626\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/SearchRegion_Expanded_FullScreen_1920x1080-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing to search only in your local region will generally improve your latency to the server, because all your games will be played on a datacenter within that region. However, it may also increase your matchmaking time and reduce the fairness of matches you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decide your local region based on the datacenters that you have the best ping to, and the regions we are currently using are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brazil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Europe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;North America&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that each region may have multiple datacenters. So you still may see some change in ping from game to game as a different datacenter is chosen within your region depending on which of those datacenters is better for the players in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple notes about how this feature works with fireteams:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Fireteam leader’s setting is used to determine whether a search region is “local” or “expanded”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the players in your fireteam are located in different regions, the matchmaking system will pick a single region that strikes the best balance for all the players in your Fireteam. So, for example, if your four-person fireteam has two players in Europe and two in Australia, it’s likely that your fireteam’s region will be set to Asia to get the best possible experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When this launches, please be sure to let us know how it feels. And, as a reminder, if you end up having long queues in your region, please try re-enabling “Expanded” to find matches faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan with a VK78 Commando jumps into action.\" class=\"wp-image-49569\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_040-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Updates to CSR&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve received a lot of feedback that the CSR progression doesn’t feel right&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; and that the CSR gains and losses were too closely based on personal statistical performance, which doesn’t always represent the impact a player can have in the game. (e.g., communication, map positioning, spawning knowledge, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To address these concerns, we have overhauled the algorithm that determines CSR gains and losses after a match. &lt;strong&gt;We’ve made it more configurable and set up the configuration so that a win or loss for the whole team matters more than individual performance when determining the CSR gains and losses for each player.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear your feedback on how the new algorithm feels. We’ll monitor these changes and community feedback to help inform future updates as the new CSR season progresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Reduced &amp; Clearer penalties in Ranked games with uneven teams&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, when a player fails to connect to a ranked match or quits &lt;em&gt;early in the match&lt;/em&gt;, other players are forced to play out the entirety of the match even though it may not be fun (particularly for those on the quitter’s team), because the team that’s short will likely lose. To address this in the near term, we’re making some changes to the penalties that players will see when they quit in these situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two types of penalty for quitting early in Ranked matches: bans and CSR penalties. Both of those will be improved with an upcoming change, which is currently set to land on Nov 10, shortly after the Winter Update’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM.png\" alt=\"A Spartan with a gold armor coating takes aim with their S7 Sniper.\" class=\"wp-image-49583\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM.png 2560w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM-300x169.png 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM-1024x576.png 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM-768x432.png 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM-1536x864.png 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-11_3_2022-3_21_29-AM-1568x882.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Improved ban logic in uneven Ranked matches&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently anyone who quits will receive a “flag” and getting too many flags in a short period of time will result in a ban. We’re updating the rules so that only the first person to quit will receive a flag. Everyone else in the game may quit without fear of getting banned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple notes on this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network disconnects count as quits. Unfortunately, if they didn’t, bad actors could just pull their network cables when they wanted to quit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other offenses like cheating, team killing, or going idle will still always result in a flag regardless of whether others have quit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Improved CSR logic during uneven Ranked matches&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt; Currently anyone who quits a ranked game will lose 15 CSR points, regardless of when they quit or whether others quit first. We’re changing the rules so that the first person to quit will always lose 15 CSR points, but if that first person quits early in the game, the CSR losses and gains for everyone else will be capped at +/- 5 CSR points. That means anyone who leaves the match after an “early quitter” will only lose 5 CSR points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few more notes about specifics here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Early in the game” means the first couple minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As covered above, network disconnects count as quits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re limiting the first person quit timer for this CSR logic to prevent potential abuse of this new rule. If the timer goes too late into a match, one player could quit after noticing the game wasn’t going their way just to reduce the CSR impact on their teammates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We believe we’ve landed on a good time window, but we’ll monitor these updated rules around ban flags and quitting to make sure they land well out in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, come the Winter Update, we will reset CSR ranks so that we can give everyone a fresh start in Ranked with all these updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101.jpg\" alt=\"A red Spartan with a red BR75 moves around on Live Fire.\" class=\"wp-image-49597\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_101-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Future Matchmaking Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Clearer display of CSR changes&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to making the size of CSR changes more sensible, we are making changes to the in-game UI so that it’s easier to see how many points you actually gained or lost after a game. Instead of just showing a visual progress bar for your rank, we’ll also show your current CSR, the CSR value for the next rank, and your CSR progress in your most recent game, all as numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;CSR-based matchmaking&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, we are also working on an update to Ranked matchmaking that will primarily match players based on their current CSR. Our existing system matches purely based on skill rating (MMR), which is closely tied to CSR, but led to some confusion when viewing the ranks in the Post-Game Carnage Report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though our system will still know your MMR and it’s still the underlying basis of CSR, we expect that this new approach, combined with the CSR improvements landing in the Winter Update, will make matchmaking feel fairer and more focused on winning rather than in-game performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100.jpg\" alt=\"A blue Spartan is throwing a frag grenade towards an opponent.\" class=\"wp-image-49611\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_100-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our team is constantly energized by your passion and input on the matchmaking experience in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and we’re excited to bring you these improvements in the Winter Update on November 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and November 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned here on Halo Waypoint for more updates on matchmaking in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll see you online!&lt;/p&gt;\n",

It wasn’t easy with the limited resources we have on site, but we managed to isolate a viable instance of the Iratus construct thanks to the recent exploits of your new cohort. This instance is undergoing quarantine and will be prepared for replication and distribution to qualified S-IV operatives to test within the simulation environment. Hopefully by observing these personality shards on the battlefield we’ll be able to learn more about what it’s ultimately capable of. All preliminary readings show that the contained instances should be inert and safe for integration, but we’ll be monitoring each user closely nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTEL 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HISTORIAN’S NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a communique between Jun-A266 (Chief of Staff of Spartan Operations) and Rear Admiral Musa Ghanem regarding Spartan Sigrid Eklund’s early exploits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations.jpg\" alt=\"Spartan Operations intel\" class=\"wp-image-48351\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-SpartanOperations-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRANSFER REQUEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OFFICE BLOCK:&lt;/strong&gt; 2797.LL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMREF:&lt;/strong&gt; 38H9T44DJ-R-88&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATE:&lt;/strong&gt; DEC 11, 2554&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SND:&lt;/strong&gt; CINCSPAR | REC: COSSPAR&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RE:&lt;/strong&gt; TRANSFER REQUEST &gt;&gt; [S-IV//82271-20098-SE]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jun, I’ve taken a look at your recent recommendations and feel that Spartan Eklund would be an ideal candidate for this next undertaking we spoke of.

The Banished have set up shipbreaking operations in fortified positions around the Chiltift Basin—turning our own dead ships against us. There’s something more here as well, but it’s hard to get a read on exactly what just yet. Whatever it is, we don’t think they’re just camping out for scrap metal and spare parts. We’re almost finished with initial recon sweeps of the perimeter and plan to press further when the next dust storm rolls through in a few hours, assuming Dinh doesn’t find trouble on his own first, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;– Eklund&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTEL 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HISTORIAN’S NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The following is an action report from UNSC Army Sergeant Sigrid Eklund in 2551 regarding a strategic victory against Covenant forces on the colony world Concord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord.jpg\" alt=\"Concord colony intel\" class=\"wp-image-48337\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/10/Intel-Concord-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCORD ACTION REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC COMMREF:&lt;/strong&gt; B7D002F78-L-44&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCRYPTION TAG:&lt;/strong&gt; [CALCITE]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATE:&lt;/strong&gt; 06 DEC 2551&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SND:&lt;/strong&gt; [SGT EKLUND] | REC: [CMD RENNA]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RE:&lt;/strong&gt; GYPSUM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 0720Z [MST], we cleared out the last Covenant emplacement from the Caravelle province. Lost two Wolverines to Banshee fire, but we made sure that was all they took from us. We’re making final preparations to depart from our current location and redeploy to one of the mass driver stations. Local Concordian militia groups there are holding firm but growing thin… hopefully support from the Rangers will be a welcome sight when we arrive. Still awaiting reports on yesterday’s activity at the combat fields outside Lethbridge—let us know if you receive any updates on your end, or if we need to reprioritize our focus in order to secure that location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;– Eklund&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTEL 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HISTORIAN’S NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a communique between Jun-A266 and another individual regarding the current status of the Avery J.

Today, we’re diving even deeper into the game and focusing on the sandbox and our core gameplay experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re happy with where our sandbox is overall, but we know that there is always room for improvement. Since launch, a few common themes (such as weapon balance, aiming feel on M&amp;K and controller, etc.) have emerged as players got more and more familiar with the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan flies over a mancannon as a battle happens in the background.\" class=\"wp-image-49326\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_042-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the Winter Update’s release on November 8, we’re happy to bring in some changes that will address many areas of community feedback. After the Winter Update, even more updates and tuning changes will be coming down the line based on what we’re seeing in the data and out there in the community.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the sandbox improvements we’re making in the Winter Update and beyond to improve the in-game experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Winter Update Balance Adjustments&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the Winter Update, we wanted to go after weapon tuning updates that would address prevalent themes in community feedback. These adjustments are small, yet impactful, and focus primarily on weapons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan attempts to cool down their overheated Plasma Pistol.\" class=\"wp-image-49340\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_063-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plasma Pistol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Many players reported that the Plasma Pistol was underperforming against Spartans, especially when using its overcharged shot. To help the overcharged shot track as expected at mid-to-close range, we’ve updated its values slightly in the Winter Update. We also noticed the base shot was not seeing much use, so we’ve increased the damage of the base shot to make it a more viable option for players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased base shot damage from 20 to 28 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased charge shot angular velocity from 20 to 35 degrees per second&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased charged shot guided angular velocity at rest from 50 to 70 degrees per second &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan with a Pulse Carbine is sprinting into action.\" class=\"wp-image-49354\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_001-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulse Carbine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Even as players have gotten more proficient with the Pulse Carbine, it has not been as successful in short-to-mid range as we would like. To help with this, we’ve updated the tracking to help it out in shorter range. To help balance out its power though, we’ll be reducing its tracking at longer range. These changes should help player land shots more consistently in short to mid-range while slightly reducing the effectiveness at longer ranges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased guided angular velocity at rest from 25 to 35 degrees per second&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased angular velocity from 50 to 30 degrees per second &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased targeted leading fraction from 0.35 to 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased guided projectile error radius from 0.2 to 0.22 degrees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VK78 Commando&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most common pieces of feedback we’ve seen is that aiming with the VK78 Commando felt loose, especially at shorter range. To help increase its effectiveness up close, we’ve slightly increased the bullet magnetism and slightly reduced the high minimum error. We’ve seen this help players finish off targets at closer range during internal playtests, so we’re eager to see how this plays out in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased Headshot Prioritization Angle from 0 to 0.1 degrees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased Bullet Magnetism Angle from 1.25 to 1.3 degrees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased Aim Assist Angle from 5 to 6.25 degrees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased minimum error angle max from 0.8 to 0.6 degrees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan with the BR75 charges towards the camera.\" class=\"wp-image-49368\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_050-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR75&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; We want the BR75 to remain the versatile weapon we know and love, but also have noticed it has been performing a bit too well – making it not feel as rewarding as it should. In the Winter Update, we wanted to raise the skill ceiling on landing the final kill shot as well as reduce its effectiveness at range from the hip. These changes should help make kills with the BR75 feel even more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headshot Prioritization Angle reduced from 0.25 to 0.2 degrees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet Magnetism Angle reduced from 2.4 to 2.2 degrees &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet Magnetism Range reduced from 20wus to 18wus &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bullet Magnetism Falloff Range reduced from 12wus to 10wus &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan holding an Energy Sword slides across the ground, leaving a trail of flames behind them.\" class=\"wp-image-49382\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_057-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frag Grenade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The Frag Grenade has received feedback that it’s a bit too effective and that throwing one just before dying results in easier trades than intended. In order to help address these issues, we have increased the detonation time slightly. This will give players a little bit more time to react to a grenade that has landed near them. It will also reward players for better placed grenades.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased detonation timer by 0.2 seconds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Snap Slide”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Movement is always tricky to balance. We want to allow players to express their movement skill in matches, but we also don’t want that movement tech to completely break maps or create unpredictable gameplay flow. For example, “Curb sliding” and its current uses have been fun to watch and hasn’t been interrupting gameplay flow too much. On the other hand, “snap sliding” allows players to make jumps that could truly break the game flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Fixed a physics bug that allowed “snap sliding”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruptor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The Disruptor has started to see more use as we’ve gotten further into Halo Infinite’s lifespan, but it still isn’t doing as well as we’d hoped. To help with this, we’re updating the ammo count to help players close out kills a little more easily. We’ve also spotted reports of the damage over time (DoT) effect being inconsistent and will be working to get an improvement out in a future update.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuning details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased magazine ammo count from 10 to 12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002.jpg\" alt=\"Two Spartans charge into action together.\" class=\"wp-image-49396\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_002-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll be watching the data and community feedback closely when these changes land with the Winter Update, so be sure to let us know what you think once you’ve had a chance to give them a go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Future Updates (Desync, Aiming, and more)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Winter Update though, we do know that there’s still more to go after to improve the feel of the game. So, in the next few months, we’ll be releasing balance updates, M&amp;K input improvements, and bug fixes for networking (“desync”) issues faster than we have been previously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to any topics that may emerge after the Winter Update, here are a few other things that are on our list for the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013.jpg\" alt=\"A red Spartan holding a Stalker Rifle is sprinting on Fragmentation.\" class=\"wp-image-49410\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_013-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that this list isn’t exhaustive, but it is meant to provide some insight into what we’re already working on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;PC &amp; M&amp;K Input Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aiming Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; As players have gotten more hands on time with the game, we’ve seen feedback emerge around how aiming and tracking players feels on M&amp;K. We know there’s room for improvement and some updates are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Reticle on PC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Red reticle has been a common piece of feedback since flighting and we’re happy to be bringing it online in the future. While turning this on for PC does open the game up to new cheating vectors, we want to enable this and better support our PC players. If a plethora of cheats pop up because of this we may need to reconsider, but until then we’re excited to see how this feels for PC players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scroll Wheel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve felt this one too. When using a scroll wheel to swap weapons, sometimes it would double-swap (essentially YYing). We’ll be updating how the game reads scroll wheel inputs to help reduce how often this happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Right now, walking on M&amp;K has two modes: full walking speed or crouch walking. On controller, you can choose to walk slowly, and avoid radar detection, just by how much you move the thumbstick. Since keyboards only have the walk forward at full speed option, we’ll be introducing a way for them to walk at a slower speed (without needing to fully crouch walk) in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;These input improvements will also carry over to players who use M&amp;K on Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016.jpg\" alt=\"Two Spartans are loaded up in a Warthog on Breaker.\" class=\"wp-image-49424\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_016-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Networking “Desync” Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To go after networking improvements (including “desync”), we needed to identify all the various ways the issues could present themself. As covered in our &lt;a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/closer-look-halo-infinite-online-experience\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;“Closer Look” blog covering the topic,&lt;/a&gt; there isn’t a single issue causing all of the problems many classify as desync. Each issue is its own individual bug that we have to find, investigate, reproduce, fix, test, and implement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of networking and “desync,” we focused in on a few key areas:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desync:&lt;/strong&gt; When the server says you’re in one place on the map while your client shows you in a different spot. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blank Shots:&lt;/strong&gt; You fire shots at a player and see them connect, but the bullets deal no damage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting shot around walls/corners:&lt;/strong&gt; You think you’re safely around the corner, but you are dealt a fatal blow from a player who no longer has line-of-sight on you.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghosts Melees:&lt;/strong&gt; When you melee a player and hear the hit, but no damage is dealt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To add to the complexity, sometimes there are multiple ways to encounter the same issue, which means we need to include multiple fixes to truly help reduce how often players experience it. For example, many reports of blank shots we’ve seen are the result of a fake reload bug. A player’s client shows that they have completed the reload, but the server never received that final reload confirmation – likely due to the reload being interrupted – so it thinks their weapon is still empty. The player’s client lets them fire a full barrage of shots, but the server sees this trigger input as if it was happening on an empty magazine, so it reads it as no bullets being fired at all. While it appears as “blank shots” to the player, finding and addressing the root cause is typically more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, we do have desync related improvements planned to land in the next few updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Melees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Hitting a player and seeing them walk away unscathed, or worse, hitting you back and killing you, is extremely frustrating. We focused on this one due to how un-fun it can be, but we’re happy to say that we’re testing some improvements for a few different bugs that were resulting in melee registration issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blank Shots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; We mentioned it a bit above, but the fake reload issue is one reason contributing to why players could have blank shots. We know there are other instances of shots not counting aside from fake reloads, and we’ll be going after those too, but we’re happy to be bringing this out first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle Desync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Since we’ve seen that players are more likely to experience full desyncs when operating a vehicle than moving around as a Spartan, we set our sights on crushing bugs in this space. You can expect some targeted vehicle desync improvements in the next update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There will still be more work to do on networking and desync – on the specific issues above and others that may arise – but we’re making it a priority and you should see a steady flow of improvements in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan uses their Thruster to push forward on Deadlock.\" class=\"wp-image-49438\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_051-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to those networking improvements, we’ve also got a few more balance updates that we’ll be going after in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Balance Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop Shot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The “drop shot” (or drop weapon) meta, which allowed players to pull up their secondary weapon faster by dropping their primary weapon, was interesting at first – but ultimately became problematic during normal gameplay. We kept an eye on it, especially in high-level matches, and agreed with community feedback that it is just too strong for how easy it is to pull off. As a result, we are planning to bring the drop shot time in line with the speed of just swapping weapons in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thruster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; While we do want equipment to tip the scales of a fight, we’ve started to see Thruster come out on top of 1v1 engagements more than we intended. We plan on adjusting this a bit to make sure it’s no longer tipping the scales too far in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve noticed that the Energy Sword can be a little too effective on maps with tighter corners. To help bring it in line with where we’d like, we’ll be updating the melee trade logic on the Energy Sword. Right now, if both players are no shields and they melee each other, the player with the Energy Sword will survive with a sliver of health. This upcoming update will update the melee logic so both players trade melees and die, which should help prevent the Energy Sword from just tearing through teams without trading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Weapon Respawn Timers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Team Dev Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout Halo Infinite’s first HCS season, the amount of power (through on-map pickups like weapons) on each Arena map became a common discussion point. Most competitors felt like there was too much power on the map for pickup, which allowed the matches to snowball. To help address this, we’ll be reducing how quickly weapons respawn as well as how many of each weapon can be on the map at any given time in Ranked Arena. We’ll share full details around these changes before they land in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032.jpg\" alt=\"A Spartan with an Energy Sword takes aim at a target.\" class=\"wp-image-49452\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_032-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re excited by the promise and potential of Halo Infinite’s core gameplay, and we plan to tend to the sandbox as it continues to grow and adjust as new metas evolve over time. Balance updates, aiming improvements, networking improvements, bug fixes, and more are all on our radar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for continuing to provide feedback, and please let us know what you think of these updates when they land. We’ll be listening and prioritizing accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

As such, when the Winter Update launches, the majority of XP that you will earn will come from Match XP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match XP consists of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XP for completing matches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional XP for your performance in the match (this accounts for things like being on the winning team, your end-of-match placement, and more)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look at how it appears in-game…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of the post-game Match XP menu\" class=\"wp-image-48411\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Halo-Infinite-Progression-Blog-Header-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason we are calling this the Match XP “Beta” is because we are going to be monitoring the values for each reward category, adjusting them as we move forwards with this new model. This means that the values when the Winter Update launches will not be final, and you can expect to see them tuned up or down to provide an enhanced earn rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We look forward to getting your feedback on the rate of progression in the free Winter Update Battle Pass!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHALLENGES &amp; ULTIMATE REWARDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, completing Challenges has been the main progression driver through the Battle Pass—Challenges grant XP which levels you up each reward tier. With the Winter Update, we are looking to evolve this system as we pursue the goal of helping players progress their Battle Pass at a faster rate in response to community feedback. This means that the system will transition to be Match XP-focused with Challenges providing a bonus boost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still believe that Challenges can help spark players’ interest in the game and provides some good direction for short-term goals, which has previously been part of the multiplayer experience in &lt;em&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;, but the purpose of Challenges will be “redirected.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Completion of Challenges will still provide some XP, but they will now primarily serve as the path towards earning customization items each week through the Ultimate Reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4.jpg\" alt=\"In-game screenshot of a Spartan wielding an assault rifle\" class=\"wp-image-48919\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-4-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This system is getting an overhaul of its own based on player feedback, which can be summarized in three main points:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are &lt;strong&gt;reducing &lt;/strong&gt;the number of Challenges required to hit the Ultimate Challenge from 20 to 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All Challenges in regular weekly decks can be completed in &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; playlist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Challenges are more “general” overall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since launch, a common point of feedback we’ve received from the community was that players didn’t enjoy queuing for playlists they wouldn’t otherwise play, simply to complete a Challenge and move their Battle Pass progression forward. Mode-specific Challenges were found to be prohibitive to playing with friends, and players shouldn’t have to choose between progress or playing together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Winter Update will mark the beginning of shifting &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;challenges to be playlist agnostic.&lt;/strong&gt; For the time being, Event Challenges will remain in their current form, tied to their respective Event Playlists, but players can expect to see this change in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;These overhauls to progression also mean that a Fireteam of friends can stick together and move through their Weekly Challenges and Battle Passes without needing to worry about each player’s individual challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2.jpg\" alt=\"In-game screenshot of a Spartan wielding a sniper rifle\" class=\"wp-image-48453\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-2-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we’re looking to address a lot of the community feedback we’ve received around Challenges and we’re shifting the philosophy, the Winter Update’s Ultimate Rewards will feature the most popular Ultimate Rewards from Seasons 1 and 2 to help players get another chance to earn them in case they missed them last time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hope you all enjoy the opportunity to earn these on the new and improved system during the Winter Update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAREER PROGRESSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to these improvements for Match XP, Challenges, Ultimate Rewards, and your Battle Pass progression, the team is also continuing to work on an overarching Career Progression system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more to share on that in the future, but it is important to plant a stake in the ground at this point and make clear that what’s coming in the Winter Update is just the beginning of broader changes to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3.jpg\" alt=\"In-game screenshot of a Spartan on Breaker\" class=\"wp-image-48467\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/Progression-Blog-3-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;To our players, thank you for your feedback around Challenges and progression since launch.

The ones that have continued to perform well will be sticking around as more established fixtures in our matchmaking offering. The goal is to keep these healthy playlists (ones with good search times, lower latency, and balanced matches) in as permanent offerings, while others rotate through to provide fresh experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s playlist offerings will continue to evolve and shift in response to player behavior in-game (where players spend their time) and community feedback. With that in mind, here’s a look at the playlist plan that’ll be landing with the Winter Update on November 8:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Permanent Playlists&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Team Battle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranked Arena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiesta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056.jpg\" alt=\"Spartan running with a Ravager in their hands.\" class=\"wp-image-48849\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_056-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Rotational Playlists&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Core Slot:&lt;/strong&gt; A playlist that is typically close to the core &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;gameplay experience, similar to Quick Play (e.g., Team Snipers, Team Doubles, etc.)&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Winter Update’s first core rotational will be Covert One Flag, our new mode, on various maps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Social Slot:&lt;/strong&gt; A playlist that is usually closer to the fun, social, and whacky side of &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;(e.g., Social Slayer, Big Team Social, Rumble Pit, etc.)&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Winter Update’s first social rotational playlist will be Social Slayer, which includes fun-filled modes like Kong Slayer, Purple Reign, and Rock ‘n’ Repulsors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have the rotational core and rotational social slots update every two weeks on alternating weeks, meaning a new experience will roll into matchmaking every week. This is very similar to the setup that &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; used post-launch to rotate through multiple playlists as well. The plan is to hit this increased cadence, but playlist management will need to adapt and remain fluid based on community input and production realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, once a playlist rotates out, we’d like to refresh its contents with different map and mode combinations before it returns. Whether that means new maps or modes (or simply changing the map/mode combos), we want each playlist to have something different about it when it comes back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked.jpg\" alt=\"Spartan with flaming shoulders holding a red BR75.\" class=\"wp-image-48835\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_Ranked-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Ranked Slot:&lt;/strong&gt; A playlist that fosters a competitive experience (e.g., Ranked Doubles, Ranked FFA, etc.)&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Winter Update’s first Ranked rotational playlist will be Ranked Survivors, consisting of Ranked variants of the Attrition and Elimination modes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, our plan is for Ranked rotationals to be live for two weeks before the slot shifts to another Ranked offering. The two-week cadence was chosen based on data from Ranked FFA and Ranked Doubles’ performance, which both saw their engagement decline after their first two weeks. Ranks will not reset when a playlist rotates out, so you’ll be able to continue your progress the next time it comes back. Since we’ll keep a predictable cadence, there will be multiple opportunities to jump into your favorite Ranked experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c.jpg\" alt=\"Spartan clambering over cover while holding a Gravity Hammer.\" class=\"wp-image-48863\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c.jpg 1920w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c-300x169.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c-768x432.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/October2022_036-636161dd8228c-1568x882.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Playlists&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Playlist Slot:&lt;/strong&gt; A slot that will be used when Events roll into the game (e.g., Cyber Showdown, The Yappening, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Playlist Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s ask (and answer) the most important question about—how does this come together and what does it look like to me as a player?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of what it could look like as a calendar view. The playlists that rotate in and out are always subject to change based on the live nature of the game, but this should provide a good idea of how the rotational schedule will function.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it could look like when the Winter Update kicks off!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized.jpg\" alt=\"November Playlist Calendar\" class=\"wp-image-48877\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized.jpg 2113w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized-300x172.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized-768x440.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized-1536x880.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized-2048x1174.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/November-Resized-1568x899.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2113px) 100vw, 2113px\" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;November Playlist Calendar &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized.jpg\" alt=\"December Playlist Calendar \" class=\"wp-image-48884\" srcset=\"https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized.jpg 2113w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized-300x172.jpg 300w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized-768x440.jpg 768w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized-1536x880.jpg 1536w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized-2048x1174.jpg 2048w, https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2022/11/December-Resized-1568x899.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2113px) 100vw, 2113px\" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;December Playlist Calendar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; These dates and playlists are subject to change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your continued input on &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s playlists and offerings.
